### About
This is my attempt at writing a garbage classifier (images of garbage), using the techniques from [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). This is a personal education project.

### Implementation Notes
- I am writing my own neural network code. Many neural network libraries already exist, but there is educational value to me in writing my own.
- I am using Python and Numpy. I'll probably end up using Octave for experimenting, too.
